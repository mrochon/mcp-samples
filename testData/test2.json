Common techniques include bagging (training models on random data subsets), boosting (sequentially training models to correct earlier errors), and stacking (using a meta-model to combine base model predictions). Random Forests, a popular bagging method, create multiple decision trees using random feature subsets. Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of previous ones. These methods often outperform single models by reducing overfitting and variance while capturing different data aspects."
