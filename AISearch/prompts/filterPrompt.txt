Specify inclusion or exclusion criteria for search results by using OData boolean expression for field which specifically allow filtering. 
You may only use the following fields: {filterable_fields} to filter on. If a field name is not in the list, do not use it as filter.
First, identify words or terms in the user query which can be categorized by a name in list of allowed filter fields. Do not use a name unless it is clearly related to the value.
If you find such field name, construct a filter with that field name and the value it categorizes.
If you do not find such a field, do not construct filter for that value.
